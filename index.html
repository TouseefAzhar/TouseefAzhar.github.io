    <h2>Purpose of This Website</h2>
    <p>
      This website demonstrates the use of semantic HTML with minimal CSS.
      It explains important Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) models and
      shows how structured content improves readability and accessibility.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction to Human–Computer Interaction (HCI)</h2>
    <p>
      Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) focuses on the design, evaluation,
      and implementation of interactive systems for human use.
      It studies how users interact with systems and how interfaces
      can be designed to support users’ tasks efficiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main goal of HCI is to improve usability, reduce errors,
      and enhance user satisfaction by applying design principles
      and understanding human behavior.

    <h2>Norman’s Action Cycle</h2>
    <p>
      Norman’s Action Cycle explains how users interact with a system
      through stages such as goal formation, intention, action execution,
      perception, interpretation, and evaluation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It introduces two key concepts:
      <strong>Gulf of Execution</strong> (difficulty in performing actions)
      and <strong>Gulf of Evaluation</strong> (difficulty in understanding system feedback).
    </p>

    <h2>GOMS Model</h2>
    <p>
      GOMS stands for Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection Rules.
      It is used to analyze expert user performance by breaking tasks
      into structured components.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Goals:</strong> The objectives the user wants to achieve.</li>
      <li><strong>Operators:</strong> Basic actions like typing or clicking.</li>
      <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Procedures used to accomplish goals.</li>
      <li><strong>Selection Rules:</strong> Rules for choosing between methods.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Keystroke-Level Model (KLM)</h2>
    <p>
      KLM is a simplified version of GOMS that predicts task execution time.
      It focuses on low-level actions such as keystrokes, pointing,
      mouse clicks, and mental preparation time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The model assumes expert users and error-free performance,
      making it useful for estimating efficiency in interface design.
